# C1 - Uploaded images will be resized

All uploaded images will be resized and thereby rewritten.

Resizing the images serves four purposes:
 - the necessary facilities to store the images is spared.
 - the network bandwidth to deliver those images is reduced.
 - attacks using images with embedded viruses are denied.
 - attempts to distribute concealed information in an image are prevented.
