# A2 - Frontend is resilient against connection loss

The frontend should be resilient against a not reachable or responding server.
That means the frontend should for any REST requests:
 - inform the user, that the connection is currently lost
 - automatically postpone and retry those request in the background
 - inform the user as soon as the connection is reestablished

This requirement only applies to ajax/REST requests the frontend does. It may not
be applied to requests the browser does natively, for instance GET requests to retrieve
HTML-, CSS-, JS- or font-files.
